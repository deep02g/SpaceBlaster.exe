# SpaceBlaster.exe
A 2D space shooter game.

This game is inspired from space inavders. The world is in 2D and art is a mix of pixelated art and modern. 
The game has 3 levels.  It has a dynamic enemy system, it has three types: stationery, spawners, and chasers. Each of these types can be mismatched via scripts.
It also has a dynamic camera look, with 2D pixelated art. Assets from unity store and icth.io have been used, and it is heavily inspired by Space Invaders.
The three levels are fully designed and ready to play.




-> Level 1 is closed and very tight.

-> Level 2 is semi-open and you can choose which way you want to go, eventually looping through the areas.
